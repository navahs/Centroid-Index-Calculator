1. Installation instructions for MacOS
During the installation, one may see this error message:
“Centroid_Index_Calculator_Installer” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified”.
It might be necessary to refer to the MacOS setting to make changes to allow the app to be installed, as follows: 
Security & privacy>General>App store & identified developer>Open anyway.
Then, the installer will pop up on the screen. 
The installation steps include:
DESTINATION>MATLAB RUNTIME>CONFIRMATION
This way, the “MATLAB Runtime” will be automatically downloaded on the system. 
To open the software, please refer to:
Applications>Centroid_Index_Calculator folder>Application>Centroid_Index_Calculator
After a while, the “MATLAB app” will appear on the screen.

2. Installation instructions for Windows:
The installation of the software is more straightforward for Windows. 
The same “warning” notification might appear during the software installation due to security and privacy which is easily solvable.

Notes:
1. This software is developed to process Excel file data, in which the data are (by default) spaced by “tab”. Therefore, the only step for the user is to copy/paste data from the Excel file to the appropriate boxes in the software. 
2. If one chooses to enter the data manually, regardless of whether the data points are separated by “commas” or “tabs”, it is necessary to be consistent for all data. For example, the software will not be able to analyze the data and calculate the CI if the data for “time” are separated by “comma” and the data for OD are separated by “tab”.
3. The software does not work for data with decimal points represented as “comma” instead of “period”. For example, the data must be 0.2 and not 0,2. This problem might appear if the Excel file is in a language other than English. 
4. Once the calculations are done for a series of data, it is possible to delete the calculated value of CI in the associated box and then enter a new data set.
